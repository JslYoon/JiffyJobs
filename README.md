# JiffyJobs

JiffyJobs is a job board curated for students to find quick jobs either on-campus or off-campus. These jobs may consist of becoming a notetaker, babysitting, petwalker, etc. JiffyJobs will act like a middleman for both students and job providers for job posting, job applying, and contact information sharing.
